# One Bit Penguin Game

A game for one bit jam #5 with the theme being `❄️ Winter ❄️`. I've spent the past day thinking about what type of game to make, but I've settled on **a penguin sliding on ice**. Plan currently is to make it a racing game with multiple stages. This is a solo project.

If you want to know more details, the GDD file has all of my thoughts and design decisions.

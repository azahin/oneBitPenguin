This is Greg.
Greg is a penguin.
Greg is sad because he can't go fast.
But this winter, the temperature has been near 0 celsius.
The snow has been falling, melting, and refreezing.
Every road is covered with slippery ice.
Greg can now go fast.

sidenote: change this to a tanka style poem. because it's fun

## Concept

This is a racing game where you race to get the shortest time in different stages. The player is a `-.-` face penguin which can be controlled to go fast. The goal of this game is to learn more about shading and map making.

### Theme Interpretation

The `❄️ Winter ❄️` theme is explored with the game's initial idea. When I think of winter, I think of the weather. The best weather in the winter is when the snow is nice and fluffy, and the worst weather is when it's near 0 celsius. At that point, there barely is snow and the "snow" basically becomes invisible slippery ice.

So, what type of game would be good with any of those two types of weather? Then I came across those Minecraft boats on ice going really fast. And so, I had my game idea.

  - Chiptune to further go along with the 1 bit aesthetic
  - DNB for the high energy feels

## Gameplay

### Mechanics

Racing game type mechanics

- WASD & Left Stick to face a direction
- Mouse & Right Stick to move camera
- Left Click & RB to accelerate
- Right Stick & LB to brake

### Dynamics

Everything is slippery

- Slow acceleration
- Easy to drift
- Able to get to high speeds

### Aesthetics

I want players to feel the speed

- Feeling of skill expression in controlling speed
- Feeling of light hearted fun

## Art

The entire jam is a 1 bit jam. So there's 2 colours.

- Since penguins are mostly black and white anyway, it works out
- Learn and use simple shaders to turn a 3d environment to flat black and white
- Focus on outlines and shading with checkers or dots like manga
- Mainly use simple shapes already in unity
- For other models
  - Use free models from asset store (credited, of course)
  - Try using blender for simple stuff

## Music

Chiptune DNB

- Use Ableton for production.
  - Only use chiptune sounds
  - Panning and higher fidelity effects are allowed
  - Any samples must be bit crushed

## Narrative

Simple, quick and light hearted

- Greg is sad because he can't go fast.
- But Greg is `-.-`
- He remains `-.-` after each level
- He continues to find places to be fast
- At the end, Greg gets a smirk on their face

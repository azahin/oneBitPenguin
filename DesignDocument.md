This is Greg.
Greg is a penguin.
Greg is sad because he can't go fast.
But this winter, the temperature has been near 0 celsius.
The snow has been falling, melting, and refreezing.
Every road is covered with slippery ice.
Greg can now go fast.

## Concept

This is a racing game where you race to get the shortest time in different stages. The player is a `-.-` face penguin which can be controlled to go fast. The goal of this game is to learn more about shading and map making.

### Theme Interpretation

The `❄️ Winter ❄️` theme is explored with the game's initial idea. When I think of winter, I think of the weather. The best weather in the winter is when the snow is nice and fluffy, and the worst weather is when it's near 0 celsius. At that point, there barely is snow and the "snow" basically becomes invisible slippery ice.

So, what type of game would be good with any of those two types of weather? Then I came across those Minecraft boats on ice going really fast. And so, I had my game idea.
